# Crop Yield Prediction using Random Forest Regression

## Overview
This project aims to predict crop yield by leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically employing Random Forest Regression. The predictive model utilizes agricultural parameters to estimate crop yields.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains agricultural data encompassing various factors influencing crop yield, such as land preparation methods, irrigation hours, fertilizer application details, and more.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values: Strategies were employed to manage missing data effectively.
Feature engineering: Extracted relevant features and transformed data for optimal model performance.
Scaling and encoding: Numerical scaling and categorical encoding were performed for better model training.

## Model Development
Random Forest Regression: Chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships and provide accurate predictions in regression tasks.
Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuned model parameters to optimize performance.

## Model Evaluation / Results
The model's performance was assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), a measure of the deviation between predicted and actual crop yields. The achieved RMSE stands at 272.19, indicating the model's effectiveness in yield prediction.
